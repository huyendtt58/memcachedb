==================================
'rget' - range query based on keys
==================================

Command Specification
=====================

rget <start key> <end key> <left openness flag> <right openness flag> <max items>\r\n

- <start key> where the query starts.
- <end key>   where the query ends.
- <left openness flag> indicates the openness of left side, 0 means the result includes <start key>, while 1 means not.
- <right openness flag> indicates the openness of right side, 0 means the result includes <end key>, while 1 means not.
- <max items> how many items at most return, max is 100.

After this command, the client expects zero or more items, each of
which is received as a text line followed by a data block. After all
the items have been transmitted, the server sends the string

"END\r\n"

to indicate the end of response.

Each item sent by the server looks like this:

VALUE <key> <flags> <bytes>\r\n
<data block>\r\n

- <key> is the key for the item being sent

- <flags> is the flags value set by the storage command

- <bytes> is the length of the data block to follow, *not* including
  its delimiting \r\n

- <data block> is the data for this item.

Notice: all keys in MemcacheDB is sorted alphabetically, so is the return of query result.
